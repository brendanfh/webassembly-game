Goals of this project:
  ☐ Make a working game using Emscripten and WebAssembly

Graphics Engine:
  ✔ Better way to buffer data @done(17-11-05 22:23)
    ✔ A place to store the buffered data @done(17-11-05 21:26)
    ✔ Use bufferSubData @done(17-11-05 17:58)
  
  ✔ Quad-based engine @started(17-11-05 20:52) @done(17-11-05 22:23) @lasted(1 hour 31 minutes 36 seconds)
    ✔ Implement a quad class @done(17-11-05 22:23)
      ✔ Buffers self to gfx @done(17-11-05 22:23)
    ✔ Switch to using drawElements @done(17-11-05 21:26)

  ✔ Widths and Heights are resizable @done(17-11-06 13:33)
  ✔ Canvas widths and heights don't affect mouse positions @done(17-11-06 13:33)

  ☐ Use textures in the engine @started(17-11-06 14:04)
    ☐ Load textures using SDL
    ☐ Create a system to draw using OpenGL

Implement an Input System:
  ✔ Mouse @started(17-11-06 12:58) @done(17-11-06 13:32) @lasted(34 minutes 22 seconds)
    ✔ Get position @done(17-11-06 13:08)
    ✔ Get buttons down @done(17-11-06 13:08)
  ✔ Keyboard @started(17-11-06 11:18) @done(17-11-06 12:58) @lasted(1 hour 40 minutes 7 seconds)
    ✔ Get keys that are down @done(17-11-06 11:47)
    ✔ Get keys that were just pressed @done(17-11-06 12:58)
